## INTRODUCTION
  Our assignment will be able to accomplish reading the command line and executing the appropriate commands. It will be able
  to differentiate between OR, AND, and a semicolon until an exit command is reached. Our design pattern illustrates the use
  of composite classes referenced from parent classes. The design contains classes for the command tokens, as well as classes
  for the connectors. The connector class has subclasses for each connector (AND, OR, and SEMICOLON), and there is one 
  subclass for the tokens class as well. All subclasses have a run function designed to run the command prompt in sync with 
  the connectors next to the command token.
