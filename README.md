## INTRODUCTION
  Our assignment will be able to accomplish reading the command line and executing the appropriate commands. It will be able
  to differentiate between OR, AND, and a semicolon until an exit command is reached. Our design pattern will depend on ||,
  && and ; (OR, AND, and SEMICOLON). The problem will be determining how these patterns will react on the command line with
  the commands. The solution to this problem will be a file containing specifications for when one of these three patterns
  are reached, and how the command line will react depending on the pattern.
  We learn how to use three new Linux commands: fork , execvp , waitpid.
